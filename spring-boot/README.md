# Framb√¥ Confeitaria Backend Study

This is the main application for this study project: a Spring Boot MVC web app for a cookie store e-commerce system. It's the follow-up to [this project](https://github.com/mattoi/fcc-spring-boot-tutorial) where I coded along a FreeCodeCamp tutorial. This MVC app provides a database integration and endpoints to access it. The database is set to be containerized for easy setup. You can perform various CRUD operations to manipulate customer, product and order data. I implemented the operations I thought would be useful in a real-life scenario.

This project features a PostgreSQL database and a repository layer using JDBC. The controllers provide endpoints for managing customers, products and orders. Each request is passed down to the service layer for data validation, checking for errors that the user can correct on their next request. If the request is valid, then it's passed to the repository. I tried to provide coherent status codes and error messages based on good experiences I've had using previous third-party APIs.

For learning purposes, I tried to do as much manual work as possible so I understand how things work without relying on too many abstractions. This includes using JDBC over JPA or CrudRepository, and manually writing the API docs instead of using SpringDoc.

There are also unit tests for the service layer and integration tests for the controller layer. I wrote one test of each type for each possible response code, i.e successfully update customer (204)/ failed to find customer to update (404) / invalid fields for updating (422). All the tests are working properly.

As for the remaining tasks, there are only small readability and refactoring things, so I can do these later. The core features of the application should be working exactly as I wanted them to.

### TODO
- Make sure the unit and integration tests are working.
- Use the logger where applicable.
- Consider implementing better null checking across the project.
- Implement authentication.
- Settle on using either order status id or order status name.
- Some minor fixes marked TODO in the class files.

## How To Run This Application

Requirements:
- Windows, Linux or Mac OS
- Java 17 
- Docker Desktop (for the PostgreSQL container)

Setup:
1. Clone the project repository
2. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
3. Go to the `./spring-boot/` folder
4. (Optional) To start the database container independently from the application, run `docker compose up`. Otherwise it will be started automatically with the Spring application, and stopped when it closes.
5. Run `./gradlew bootRun` to start the application. If you want to use the provided example database rows (recommended for first launch), run `./gradlew bootRun --run-initial-data'` instead. This will restore the tables to the example values if they have been modified as well.

The database schema is set to be executed on startup. After launching the app, you can try out the endpoints with a HTTP client like Postman. The provided [request collection](src\main\resources\Frambo.postman_collection.json) can be imported to Postman for an easy setup.

## API Documentation

Here you can find descriptions for each type of JSON object representing an entity in the application and the endpoints for their manipulation. Fields with a * can't be null, but depending on the HTTP method, some of them can be omitted. I did implement some Delete methods, but realized that the relational structure will rarely allow any deletions, so I chose to disable them.


### Customer

### Order

Represents an order, always assigned to a customer and containing one or more items.

| Field        | Type          | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| id*          | int           | Unique identifier.                             |
| customerId*  | int           | Refers to the customer that made the order.    |

| statusName*  | string(50)    | Refers to an existing row in the status table. |
| dateCreated* | LocalDateTime | Moment when the order was created.             |

Each order's items is stored as a row in a separate table of **order items**.

The **status** table serves as an enum, currently with only 4 values: `PAYMENT_PENDING`, `SHIPPED`, `DELIVERED` and `CANCELED`.

## Project structure
This project features a package-by-feature structure. This means that each entity and all of the classes directly involving it are in the same folder. This made more sense to me, as imports are naturally handed in each package. Details on each layer of the application are descibed below.

### Database
The application uses a PostgreSQL database that's containerized using Spring Boot's Docker integration. The [schema](spring-boot\src\main\resources\schema.sql) and some [initial data](spring-boot\src\main\resources\initial_data.sql) for easy testing of the HTTP calls are provided in the resources folder. I tried to add as many constraints as I thought would be in line with a cookie store's business logic, such as not allowing zero-item orders or multiple products with the same name or description. These rules are also checked in the Service layer when possible, to prevent unnecessary database calls. 

The following is a diagram representation of the database's schema.

![A picture containing a diagram representation of the database's schema](schema.png "Schema Diagram")

### Model Layer
Each entity is mostly a 1-to-1 representation of its database, except for the order items, which compose a list inside the pertaining order. I chose to use records for the classes, as there shouldn't be any attribute editing involved anywhere in the application's workflow. 

I am considering, however, using Null checking and consequently implementing a "Request" class for each model, as the nullable fields would need to be different between them. If I was using a more modern language I would probably have to do that, but since Java has such an "opt-in" implementation of null checking, I guess the current method works for now.

### Repository Layer
The repository classes use `jdbcClient` to interact with the database by using direct SQL queries and operations. I found out about JPA while implementing this layer, and I see how it can be useful for faster prototyping and less error-prone queries, but I wanted to practice my SQL so I went with JDBC instead. Also, apparently JPA can run about 4x slower than JDBC? I didn't test it, but writing pure SQL didn't hurt. 

### Service Layer
The `@Service` layer is meant to validade requests coming in from the controllers to make sure the request bodies are in line with the business logic. In case of an invalid request, the methods in this layer will attempt to point out all the errors that need fixing in order to turn it into a valid one.

### Controller Layer
This layer uses `@RestController` to offer HTTP endpoints for the various database operations implemented in the project. By default, `@ModelAttribute` uses Jackson to automatically convert the data classes into JSON and vice-versa, but in some methods it was preferrable to use `@RequestBody` with a `Map` to get more specific results. Each method returns an appropriate response code for each type of input, and show the errors found in the Service layer when applicable.
