# Framb√¥ Confeitaria Mock Backend

This is the main application for this study project: a Spring Boot web app for a cookie store e-commerce system. It's the follow-up to [this project](https://github.com/mattoi/fcc-spring-boot-tutorial) where I coded along a FreeCodeCamp tutorial. This app provides a database integration and endpoints to access it. The database is set to be containerized for easy setup. You can perform various CRUD operations to manipulate customer, product and order data. I implemented the operations I thought would be useful in a real-life scenario.

Right now the application works roughly as intended, accepting valid request bodies and rejecting invalid entries (thanks to the database schema), but it's not doing a good job on communicating what's wrong with each invalid request. The response codes are all over the place and there's no exception handling to communicate that throughout the app, either. My next steps after writing the initial documentation are implementing exceptions and response entities.

## How To Run This Application

Requirements:
- Windows, Linux or Mac OS
- Docker Desktop (for the PostgreSQL container)
- Java 17 or later

Setup:
1. Clone the project repository
2. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
3. Go to the `./spring-boot/` folder
4. (Optional) To start the database container independently from the application, run `docker compose up`. Otherwise it will be started automatically with the Spring application, and stopped when it closes.
5. Run `./gradlew bootRun` to start the application. If you want to use the provided example database rows (recommended for first launch), run `./gradlew bootRun --args='--initializeDefaultValues=true'` instead.

The database schema is set to be executed on startup. After launching the app, you can try out the endpoints with a HTTP client like Postman. The provided [request collection](src\main\resources\Frambo.postman_collection.json) can be imported to Postman for an easy setup.

## API Documentation

Here you can find descriptions for each type of JSON object representing an entity in the application and the endpoints for their manipulation. Fields with a * can't be null, but not all of them are required in a request body. I did implement some Delete methods, but realized that the relational structure will rarely allow any deletions, so I omitted them.

##### TODO
- Provide the appropriate response codes and bodies (when necessary) for better clarity. Right now, pretty much every successful call returns a 200 and every unsuccessful call returns a 500.
- Update response bodies in this section after the implementation.
- Consider changing Put requests to Patch, as they're not supposed to replace *all* of an object's fields (i.e the ID should always stay the same).
- Consider using id as a path parameter for update methods instead of being included in the request body.

### Customer

Represents a store customer, with a name, contact information and an ID that's tied into any orders they create.

| Field        | Type        | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

}
```

```

```
500 Internal Server Error

#### [PATCH] Update customer

##### Responses
```
